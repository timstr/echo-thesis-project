This repository contains essentially all code used for model definitions, synthetic dataset generation, training, evaluation, visualization, dataset management, and various and sundry helpers and utilities that I used during my thesis research project at UBC. I no longer actively work on this project but for clarifications, please refer to [the thesis paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0402577) or contact me at [straubinger.tim@gmail.com](mailto:straubinger.tim@gmail.com). For the data used in our experiments, please refer to [the project website](https://timstr.github.io/learned-acoustic-reconstruction/).
